**PIXS** is a minimal, dark-mode-first note-taking and reminders app for macOS. It's built for people who like pixels, ghosts, and getting things done without the bloat.

## 🌟 Features

- **Notes**: Clean, Apple Notes-style editor with markdown support.
- **Reminders**: Integrated tasks with direct calendar access.
- **AI Companion**: Optional Gemini integration to chat with your notes.
- **Vibe**: Animated header, smooth hover effects, and a "Glass Liquid" aesthetic.
- **Privacy**: Your data stays local (unless you send it to Gemini).

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **SwiftUI**: 100% native macOS declarative UI.
- **AppKit**: For that sweet menu bar integration.
- **UserNotifications**: For local reminders and alerts.
- **Gemini 2.0 Flash**: For the brain.
