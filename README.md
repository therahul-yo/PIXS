- **Reminders**: Integrated tasks with direct calendar access.
- **AI Companion**: Optional Gemini integration to chat with your notes.
- **Vibe**: Animated header, smooth hover effects, and a "Glass Liquid" aesthetic.
- **Privacy**: Your data stays local (unless you send it to Gemini).

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **SwiftUI**: 100% native macOS declarative UI.
- **AppKit**: For that sweet menu bar integration.
- **EventKit**: To know your schedule.
- **Gemini 2.0 Flash**: For the brain.
